# LifeHacks
Tips &amp; Tricks to improve efficiency

This is my adventure into video content - the idea is to create short videos around ideas that make things easier.
I'm a database engineer with a passion for automation, so I imagine a lot of the topics will be around that theme.

I'll try and keep the below list up-to-date with links to my videos and scripts. Watch this space.

## Live LifeHacks

### dbatools

### Ideas for future hacks
If there is something you'd like to see me cover create an issue and I'll see what I can do.

Ideas I have:
- Git
    - Getting started with dbatools - fork, clone, create a feature branch
    - Rebasing branch when upstream changed

- dbatools
    - Export-DbaInstance - easy environment documentation
    - Write-DbaDataTable

- dbachecks
    - run adhoc checks post server restart
